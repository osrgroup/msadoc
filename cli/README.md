# MSAdoc CLI

1. Copy the `msadoc-upload.sh` script to your project repository. Make it executable (e.g. `chmod +x msadoc-upload.sh`).
2. Execute the script: `msadoc-upload.sh -s SERVER_IP -k API_KEY [-f FILE_PATH]`

## Future Plans

- We want to publish an npm package that can be used instead of copying and pasting a shell script.
