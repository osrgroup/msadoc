### User Authentication

There are the following authentication mechanisms, each represented by an `AuthGuard` class:
* `JwtAccessAuthGuard` - the classic API ednpoint protection
* `UserPasswordAuthGuard` - only used to get JWT tokens
* `JwtRefreshAuthGuard` - only used to refresh a JWT access token
* `ApiKeyAuthGuard` - only used for endpoints used by CI

**Usage**: Annotate method in controller with e.g. `@UseGuards(JwtAccessAuthGuard)`
